Simple manager to get parts of the current URL. URL resolving is done in a secure way.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
---------------

It's best to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for installation, and you can also find the package on

You can use the package manually by creating an instance of the internal classes, or register a DIC extension to link the services directly to the Nette Framework.

How to use
----------

An easy-to-use library for obtaining and managing current URLs.

You will get the current URL:

```php
echo \Baraja\Url\Url::get()->getCurrentUrl();
```

A base url:

```php
echo \Baraja\Url\Url::get()->getBaseUrl();
```

Nette Url or Script Url can also be obtained for robust work with URL parts:

```php
$netteUrl = \Baraja\Url\Url::get()->getNetteUrl();

echo $netteUrl->getDomain();
echo $netteUrl->getPort();
echo $netteUrl->getQuery();
```

And many other getters, [see the documentation](https://github.com/nette/http) for more.
